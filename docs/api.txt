  Kit-Catalogue API (open data)
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


The Kit-Catalogue Application Programming Interface (API) allows access to 
basic information about the items in your catalogue.

The API is split in to two sections, public an private.

At the moment, only a basic form of the public interace is available.

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
    *  We will be adding more fields and functionality  *
    *  to the API in future releases.                   *
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *



== Enabling the API ==

The API is disabled by default. To enable it, edit your local config file and
change the 'api.enabled' setting to read:

  $config['api.enabled'] = true;

Once enabled, you can access the API pages by browsing to:

  http://<your-site>/api/

This page will show you the current status of the public and private API sections,
as well as linking to your data licence (if defined).



== Data Licensing ==

As mentioned above, a data licence shows your users what they can and cannot do with
your equipment data.  This applies to both the data available through the API and
through your catalogue's normal website pages.

You should use your local config to define exactly which licence you wish to use.
Kit-Catalogue includes settings for the UK's Open Goverment Licence as a useful default.


    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
    *  Which ever licence you choose to use, check its terms are suitable *
    *  for your institution before making it visible on your catalogue.   *
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


By default, the Kit-Catalogue software does not show any data licence description or
link. You can enable it by setting the appropriate local config entry to read:

  $config['data.licence_enabled'] = true;  

To change which data licence information is shown, alter these settings accordingly:

  $config['data.licence_name'] = '<name of your licence>';

  $config['data.licence_link'] = '<URL-of-full-licence-information>';



== Public API ==

The Public API itself is enabled by default. You can control the availability
of the public API using the local config setting:

  $config['api.public.enabled'] = true; 


Once enabled, you can access the public API by browsing to:

  http://<your-site>/api/public/

There you can read more information on how to use 



== Private API ==

The Private API is currently unavailable and will be added in a future
Kit-Catalogue release.

Once fully functional, the private API will allow authorised access for adding
and updating items in the catalogue, as well as providing an entry point for
external systems to harvest information about specific collections of items, or
those not marked as fully public.
