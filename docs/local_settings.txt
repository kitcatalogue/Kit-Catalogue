  Using Local Configuration Settings, CSS and Plugins
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *



**** Local Configuration ****

We advise making all your local configuration changes in local/local_config.php

The settings in local_config.php will override the defaults in app/config.php,
and when installing upgrades and system updates to Kit-Catalogue, settings defined
in your local folder will not be overwritten by any new file versions.  



**** Custom CSS ****

Put custom stylesheet changes in local/local.css
This stylesheet will be called automatically by the application, and your
changes will override the default styles.



**** Custom Layouts ****

CSS styling can only take you so far.  If you want to change large parts of 
the HTML structure of your Kit-Catalogue, you can define your own HTML layout.
There are some restrictions on what you can change with a layout template, but 
it offers far greater control that CSS alone.

To create a new layout, create an HTML template file in your local/layouts 
folder. e.g.  local/layouts/myuniversity.phtml

You also need to activate your new plugin in your local configuration, by 
pointing the $config['layout.template_file'] setting to your new layout 
template.

PLEASE NOTE : When developing a new layout, you *must* maintain all the method 
calls that pull data in from other parts of the system or Kit-Catalogue's 
operation will be severely affected, and probably break completely.

The easiest way to develop a new template is to copy the default template from 
app/layouts/default.phtml and create a new version in your local/layouts 
folder.



**** Using Plugins ****

Any .php file in the local/plugins/ folder will be read in automatically.

Define any functions you wish to add to the 'hook-points' within the system 
here, and register them with the model plugin system using:

$plugins->add('<hook-name>', function ($args) {
	<your code here>
});


See plugins.txt for more information.



**** Changing Terms and Wordings ****

Kit-Catalogue now supports the renaming of some of the labels and words used 
to describe entities and fields within the system.  Using the local language 
file, you can override the default labels and supply ones of your own.

For example, to change "department" to "school", edit local/local_language.php
(or create it, if it does not exist) and add the lines:

$lang['dept.label'] = 'School';
$lang['dept.label.plural'] = 'Schools'; 
 
If you want to alter the URL of the department pages, you can do that by 
adding a third line:

$lang['dept.route'] = 'school';

 
See app/language.php for all the different language overrides available.  This 
is very much a work in progress, so not every occurance of a word may be 
replaced at the moment, but we are working towards 100% coverage.

Please report to us any labels you find that are not overridden somewhere.
