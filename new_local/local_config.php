* SSO setup could limit how Kit-Catalogue works for your users.  Your local IT staff will need to setup your
* server for Shibboleth (e.g. Apache + mod_shib) and add your catalogue to your local SSO service provider.
*
* You must supply the config settings to map the fields in Kit-Catalogue's user information to the user attributes
* available in PHP's $_SERVER array.  The $_SERVER array is typically populated automatically by your server's
* Shibboleth setup when a user successfully logs in.
*
* The "shib.<field-name>.attr" setting should be the name of the attribute as returned in the $_SERVER array.
*
* If "shib.<field-name>.regex" is supplied, it will be used as a regular expression to extract the actual value
* from the raw attribute. If it is left blank, the raw value of the attribute will be used.
